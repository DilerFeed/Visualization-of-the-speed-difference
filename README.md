# Visualization of the speed difference

## This program allows you to easily visualize the difference in speeds when overcoming an equal distance.
### You can download ready-made applications for platforms MacOS and Windows from this link on my google drive - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14qOcKKU-xv6071EQlEBFH5u4Khfv9Ppc?usp=sharing

– The colors of the "devices" (balls) are set on line 20 (in rgb).

– The initial speeds of the balls in the simulation are set on line 23 in km/h, but can be easily changed in the interface of the running program.

– It is not recommended to change everything else, but the sizes of windows can be changed in a small range without affecting the performance of the program.

– When you run the program, you will see 4 fields for entering the speeds of each of the balls and the "Restart" button. This button restarts the simulation with the new speeds. The button must be pressed twice!

– The distance bar is calculated so that the ball with the lowest speed overcomes the path in exactly 60 seconds.
